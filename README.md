# Girl Power Talk Leaders
## Overview
This is my take on the assignment that was given to me by Girl Power Talk after the first interview.

Here is a summary of what the assignment looked like:
- Develop a landing page for Girl Power Talk highlighting your learnings from the articles and the videos we sent you.
- Try implementing a dynamic map on the website that showcases where our young leaders come from. (HINT- Pins on map).
- Use Reusable components (Headers and footers).
 
 ## Features
 - Simple landing page that's showing the values of Girl Power Talk, and that their leaders are from all over the world (pins on a map) 
 - Responsive (looks good on all devices)
 
 ## Dependencies
 - react
 - react-dom
 - framer-motion - For animations
 - react-icons - For icons
 - react-map-gl - For displaying an interactive map (will not work with any version of IE)
 - sass - CSS pre-processor
 
 ## ToDop
 - On pin hover, show a popup with name of country, flag and the leaders who comes from that country
 - Some refactoring is needed
